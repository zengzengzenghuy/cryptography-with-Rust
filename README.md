# Cryptography with Rust
This is a repo for documenting my journey of learning cryptography and Rust since Sept 2022. The content of this repo will be different cryptography applications or libraries that I want to build in order to strengthen my skills or just for fun.

## Roadmap
- [x] Customize Constraint System with Arkworks   
[ ] Customize Proof Generation
